# Powerpoint Karaoke

Powerpoint Karaoke (also called Powerpoint Roulette or Battledecks) is an improv game where a person presents a slideshow to an audience without knowing the contents of the slides.

> This project is forked from [this repo](https://github.com/huijing/ppt-karaoke/), where it aims to modernise the project by using React, and will be using most of its slides, which according to the original author, are sourced from [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FPiaWslzUpEzEQvBOsV8_Jl0Khl_wau-3VTMsuXi6es/edit?usp=sharing) 

## How to play

- There are a total of 10 slides per turn
- Before starting, set a theme for your presentation, and try to stick to it throughout!
- Try to spend 15-30 seconds per slide
- Good presentations have:
    - good flow
    - great humour
    - poking fun at your friends
    - credibility
    - get through the entire deck
